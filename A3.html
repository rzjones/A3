        <h2>The Dataset: US Population by Age and Sex*, 1900 and 2000</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> "This dataset contains a high-level summary of census data for two years a century apart: 1900 and 2000. The data is a CSV (comma-separated values) file that describes the U.S. population in terms of year, reported sex (1: male, 2: female)*, age group (binned into 5 year segments from 0-4 years old up to 90+ years old), and the total count of people per group." from 11.C35/6.C35, Interactive Data Visualization and Society, Spring 2024.</p>
        <p> The "sketches" poriton of this assignment uses rounded data, which measures the total population by age and sex in 1900 and 2000 (in thousands), rounding each figure to the nearest fifty thousand. As a result, the three sketches below do not accurately represent every data point; the purpose of these visualizations fulfills exploratory and prototypical purposes more than statistical analysis.</p> 
        <p> *There is ongoing work within the US Census Bureau to expand notions and measures of gender and sex beyond the binary. </p>

           <h2> Analysis Question </h2>
        <p> How has the US population changed from 1900 to 2000 for males and females, and how have these trends correlated with age? </p>

                        alt="A hand-drawn dual line chart shows the percent change in U.S. population from the previous age group for females. A solid line corresponds to the percent change between age groups in the year 2000, and a dashed line corresponds to the percent change between age groups in the year 1900." 
                        width = 700/>
                <p> This sketch visualizes the percent change in population size between age groups (by 10 age increments) for females. I ran a simple calculation to derive these nine data points for both years; I divided one age group's population by the preceding age group, and then multiplied the quotient by 100 to calculate a whole integer for a percent value. Using actual numbers to demonstrate, I took the population at age 10 for females in 2000 (10,550) and divided it by the population of females at age 0 in 2000 (9750). This produced a percent change increase of nearly 10%, which is visualized on the line chart by the solid line for the data point = age 10 females. I repeated this step sequentially for each age group: I divided the population of 20 year old females in 2000 (9750) by the population of 10 year old females in 2000 (10550), multiplying by 100. Since this difference is negative, the corresponding data point falls below the x-axis toward the negative percent change section of the y-axis around the -10% mark at age 20. I repeated these steps for each age group for females in 1900, visualizing the trend in percent change with a dashed line.</p>
                <p> My rationale behind this sketch was primarily exploratory. That is, I wanted to understand how the population composition changed between age groups for females in 1900 and 2000. There were clear variations in population size by age group, but rather than charting these population totals in a simple bar chart, I wanted to focus specifically on the change happening within the population. Therefore, I visualized the percent change between each age group, visualizing the peaks and valleys as in the profile of the female population in 1900 and 2000.</p>
                <p> I hoped this visualization would illuminate segments of the female population that experienced the most significant changes over a lifetime. In other words, I wanted to visualize how the female population has either grown older, younger, or stayed the same relative to age in 1900 versus 2000. I think juxtaposing both years on a single chart works well, as it shows how the population experiences more stable change between age groups (i.e. there is less steady population decline from age group to age group in 2000 compared to 1900). That said, I do not think this visualization accurately accounts for historical moments or the context at the time. For example, medical advancements and how they affected different age groups are not annotated on the chart; breakthrough medical procedures or viral diseases that could have improved (or worsened) the life expectancy of different age groups are not shown here. This additional historical context would help situate and explain some of the difference between 1900 and 2000, as well as the changes between age groups.</p>

                        alt="A hand-drawn dual line chart shows the percent change in U.S. population from the previous age group for males. A solid line corresponds to the percent change between age groups in the year 2000, and a dashed line corresponds to the percent change between age groups in the year 1900." 
                        width = 700/>
               <p> This sketch visualizes the percent change in population size between age groups (by 10 age increments) for males. The calculation here is the same from the previous visualization: I divided one age group's population by the preceding age group, and then multiplied the quotient by 100 to calculate a whole integer for a percent value. I repeated this step sequentially for each age group for males in 1900, visualizing the trend in percent change with a dashed line. This was done as well for each age group of males in 2000 with a solid trend line.</p>
               <p> Similar to my rationale for the percent change by age group for females, this sketch was primarily exploratory but for males. The data provided a different set of numbers significant enough to dedicate an individual visualization for this trend. Again, there were clear variations in the population size by age group, but these variations do not effectively or interestingly answer the primary question: "how has the population changed for males from 1900 to 2000, and how has this change over time correlated to age?". To capture the variability within each year's popualtion by age, I concentrated my focus on the change happening between ages in 1900 and 2000, visualizing how the male population grew and shrank from one age to another—in direct concert with the life expectancy of males in 1900 and 2000.</p>
               <p> Much like the first hand-drawn visualization for females, I hoped this visualization would illuminate the most significant changes in population size over a lifetime by age. Furthermore, I wanted to see how life expectancy and population age were similar and/or different between the two sexes. I think the duplicated format works well for this purpose, as it provides a comparable frame of analysis and thus easier platform to compare and contrast population change between age groups for males and females in 1900 and 2000. However, this line chart does not provide any annotative explanation that helps contextualize differential medical care, gender expectations, occupational position, or other gender-based variables between the sexes. Furthermore, much like the first visualization, I do not think this visualization illustrates how history influenced the propotion of the population by age for males. That said, it is difficult to extrapolate watershed historical moments onto a population and draw correlations between them. Not every age group or sex might have been affected by the annotated information, so these additional explanations may inadvertently lead to single-source answers to a peak or valley in population change, which could lead to a misinterpretation of the data.</p>

                <p>To situate the data, I used a choropleth map to visualize the municipalities with residential areas zoned exclusively for single-family use (1), and other municipalities where non-SFZ housing typologies are permitted (0). Presented as a binary using yellow and white, this map provides some interesting spatial patterns and clues as to residential zoning and land use; however, it does not answer deeper questions about who, what, and where upzoning efforts might be challenged, and which municipalities might have the greatest potential to upzone areas of their city. A key pattern emerges: many municipalities with Single Family Zones lie in the suburbs of Boston, but these areas are not limited to one area; they lie to the North, West, and South of the central metro region. Yellow was chosen for the visualization, since it is typically associated with single-family zoning classifications.</p>

        <h2>Summary </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Upzoning efforts within the Metropolitan Boston area must grapple with the economic, racial, historical, and spatial diversity confronting the 101 municipalities of the region. In this exploratory analysis, some of the areas with the greatest potential for upzoning and diverse housing typologies were visualized. A look into the demographic profile of Metropolitan Boston, and the amount of land that has been allocated to Single-Family Zoning provides helpful insights into how exclusionary zoning has negatively impacted the lived reality of many today. More specifically, in areas with the highest percentage of Single-Family Zoning, income and racial disparities were highest, presenting a strong correlation between SFZ and demographic homogeneity; likewise, areas that permitted other housing typologies correlated with more diverse household incomes and higher proportions of the community that were non-white. Spatial insights also emerged from this analysis. Many suburban and urban communities with Single Family Zoning have existing, non-conforming housing typologies. These apparently “illegal” structures may provide useful precedents for upzoning initiatives, particularly in extant communities where other housing typologies represent a small share of the total residential area or receive recurring pushback from community leaders.</p> 
        <p>Further spatial analysis is needed to confirm many of the relationships drawn from this initial analysis. In addition to a closer look at the historical trend of these municipalities, and how they might have changed over time in response to watershed planning/policy interventions, additional analysis with additional data—such as housing classification, assessed value, and date of construction—needs to be done. This project did not visualize household size for families (nor non-families), so the next phase of research would explore housing density across Metropolitan Boston using household sizes as the key measure Incorporating these and other data into the project will raise new questions regarding zoning, housing availability, density, and demography. Expanding the scope and breadth of these data will help highlight the historical effects of exclusionary zoning and the areas of where upzoning might be most impactful.</p>
