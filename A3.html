                <p>This visualization serves as a gateway into the data, providing a visual representation of the depth and breadth of Metropolitan Boston’s municipal zoning and land use. This bar chart visualizes the percent of residential land in a particular municipality that has been zoned exclusively for single-family homes (% SFZ). Organized in descending order, the chart shows roughly half of the 101 communities zone some proportion of their residential land for Single Family use, while the other half does not zone their residential land for Single-family use.</p>

                <p>To situate the data, I used a choropleth map to visualize the municipalities with residential areas zoned exclusively for single-family use (1), and other municipalities where non-SFZ housing typologies are permitted (0). Presented as a binary using yellow and white, this map provides some interesting spatial patterns and clues as to residential zoning and land use; however, it does not answer deeper questions about who, what, and where upzoning efforts might be challenged, and which municipalities might have the greatest potential to upzone areas of their city. A key pattern emerges: many municipalities with Single Family Zones lie in the suburbs of Boston, but these areas are not limited to one area; they lie to the North, West, and South of the central metro region. Yellow was chosen for the visualization, since it is typically associated with single-family zoning classifications.</p>

        <h2>Summary </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Upzoning efforts within the Metropolitan Boston area must grapple with the economic, racial, historical, and spatial diversity confronting the 101 municipalities of the region. In this exploratory analysis, some of the areas with the greatest potential for upzoning and diverse housing typologies were visualized. A look into the demographic profile of Metropolitan Boston, and the amount of land that has been allocated to Single-Family Zoning provides helpful insights into how exclusionary zoning has negatively impacted the lived reality of many today. More specifically, in areas with the highest percentage of Single-Family Zoning, income and racial disparities were highest, presenting a strong correlation between SFZ and demographic homogeneity; likewise, areas that permitted other housing typologies correlated with more diverse household incomes and higher proportions of the community that were non-white. Spatial insights also emerged from this analysis. Many suburban and urban communities with Single Family Zoning have existing, non-conforming housing typologies. These apparently “illegal” structures may provide useful precedents for upzoning initiatives, particularly in extant communities where other housing typologies represent a small share of the total residential area or receive recurring pushback from community leaders.</p> 
        <p>Further spatial analysis is needed to confirm many of the relationships drawn from this initial analysis. In addition to a closer look at the historical trend of these municipalities, and how they might have changed over time in response to watershed planning/policy interventions, additional analysis with additional data—such as housing classification, assessed value, and date of construction—needs to be done. This project did not visualize household size for families (nor non-families), so the next phase of research would explore housing density across Metropolitan Boston using household sizes as the key measure Incorporating these and other data into the project will raise new questions regarding zoning, housing availability, density, and demography. Expanding the scope and breadth of these data will help highlight the historical effects of exclusionary zoning and the areas of where upzoning might be most impactful.</p>
