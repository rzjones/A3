        <h2>The Dataset: US Population by Age and Sex*, 1900 and 2000</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> "This dataset contains a high-level summary of census data for two years a century apart: 1900 and 2000. The data is a CSV (comma-separated values) file that describes the U.S. population in terms of year, reported sex (1: male, 2: female)*, age group (binned into 5 year segments from 0-4 years old up to 90+ years old), and the total count of people per group." from 11.C35/6.C35, Interactive Data Visualization and Society, Spring 2024.</p>
        <p> The "sketches" poriton of this assignment uses rounded data, which measures the total population by age and sex in 1900 and 2000 (in thousands), rounding each figure to the nearest fifty thousand. As a result, the three sketches below do not accurately represent every data point; the purpose of these visualizations fulfills exploratory and prototypical purposes more than statistical analysis.</p> 
        <p> *There is ongoing work within the US Census Bureau to expand notions and measures of gender and sex beyond the binary. </p>
        <h2> Data Sketches </h2>

           <h2> Analysis Question </h2>
        <p> How has the US population changed from 1900 to 2000 for males and females, and how have these trends correlated with age? </p>

                        alt="A hand-drawn dual line chart shows the percent change in U.S. population from the previous age group for females. A solid line corresponds to the percent change between age groups in the year 2000, and a dashed line corresponds to the percent change between age groups in the year 1900." 
                        width = 700/>
                <p> This sketch visualizes the percent change in population size between age groups (by 10 year increments) for females. To produce this visualization, I divided one age group's population by the preceding age group, and then multiplied the quotient by 100 to calculate a whole integer for a percent value. Using actual numbers from the dataset to demonstrate, I took the population at age 10 for females in 2000 (10,550) and divided it by the population of females at age 0 in 2000 (9750). This produced a percent change increase of nearly 10%, which is visualized on the line chart by the solid line for the data point = age 10 females. I repeated this step sequentially for each age group: I divided the population of 20 year old females in 2000 (9750) by the population of 10 year old females in 2000 (10550), multiplying by 100. Since this difference is negative, the corresponding data point falls below the x-axis toward the negative percent change section of the y-axis around the -10% mark at age 20. I repeated these steps for each age group for females in 1900, visualizing the trend in percent change with a dashed line.</p>
                <p> My rationale behind this sketch was primarily exploratory. That is, I wanted to understand how the population composition changed between age groups for females in 1900 and 2000. There were clear variations in population size by age group, but rather than charting these population totals in a simple bar chart, I wanted to focus specifically on the change happening within the population. Therefore, I visualized the percent change between each age group, visualizing the peaks and valleys as in the profile of the female population in 1900 and 2000.</p>
                <p> I hoped this visualization would illuminate segments of the female population that experienced the most significant changes over a lifetime. In other words, I wanted to visualize how the female population has either grown older, younger, or stayed the same relative to age in 1900 versus 2000. I think juxtaposing both years on a single chart works well, as it shows how the population experiences more stable change between age groups (i.e. there is less steady population decline from age group to age group in 2000 compared to 1900). That said, I do not think this visualization accurately accounts for historical moments or the context at the time. For example, medical advancements and how they affected different age groups are not annotated on the chart; breakthrough medical procedures or viral diseases that could have improved (or worsened) the life expectancy of different age groups are not shown here. This additional historical context would help situate and explain some of the difference between 1900 and 2000, as well as the changes between age groups.</p>
                <img 
                    src="images/Sketch 2.jpg" 
                        alt="A hand-drawn dual line chart shows the percent change in U.S. population from the previous age group for males. A solid line corresponds to the percent change between age groups in the year 2000, and a dashed line corresponds to the percent change between age groups in the year 1900." 
                        width = 700/>
               <p> This sketch visualizes the percent change in population size between age groups (by 10 age increments) for males. The calculation here is the same from the previous visualization: I divided one age group's population by the preceding age group, and then multiplied the quotient by 100 to calculate a whole integer for a percent value. I repeated this step sequentially for each age group for males in 1900, visualizing the trend in percent change with a dashed line. This was done as well for each age group of males in 2000 with a solid trend line.</p>
               <p> Similar to my rationale for the percent change by age group for females, this sketch was primarily exploratory but for males. The data provided a different set of numbers significant enough to dedicate an individual visualization for this trend. Again, there were clear variations in the population size by age group, but these variations do not effectively or interestingly answer the primary question: "how has the population changed for males from 1900 to 2000, and how has this change over time correlated to age?". To capture the variability within each year's popualtion by age, I concentrated my focus on the change happening between ages in 1900 and 2000, visualizing how the male population grew and shrank from one age to another—in direct concert with the life expectancy of males in 1900 and 2000.</p>
               <p> Much like the first hand-drawn visualization for females, I hoped this visualization would illuminate the most significant changes in population size over a lifetime by age. Furthermore, I wanted to see how life expectancy and population age were similar and/or different between the two sexes. I think the duplicated format works well for this purpose, as it provides a comparable frame of analysis and thus easier platform to compare and contrast population change between age groups for males and females in 1900 and 2000. However, this line chart does not provide any annotative explanation that helps contextualize differential medical care, gender expectations, occupational position, or other gender-based variables between the sexes. Furthermore, much like the first visualization, I do not think this visualization illustrates how history influenced the propotion of the population by age for males. That said, it is difficult to extrapolate watershed historical moments onto a population and draw correlations between them. Not every age group or sex might have been affected by the annotated information, so these additional explanations may inadvertently lead to single-source answers to a peak or valley in population change, which could lead to a misinterpretation of the data.</p>

                    alt = ""A sketched dual area chart shows the U.S. population (in thousands) for males and females in 1900 and 2000. The area sketched with thick black dots corresponds to the population size for the year 1900, and the area shaded with small black dots corresponds to the year 2000."
                    width = 700/>
                <p> The final hand-drawn visualization shows the popualation for males and females in 1900 and 2000. The organization of this visualization is very intentional: I wanted to overlay one year's population over the other—while keeping the sexes separate but adjacent for easy comparison—in order to show the immensity of the total population growth across almost every variable. In other words, the superimposition of 1900 on top of 2000 allows the viewer to immediately see how the total population for both sexes across every age group listed (in increments of 10 years) has increased—most notably for 30 and 40-year olds. Rather than using different colors to represent the two different years, I chose to use textured areas instead by using different circle styles. Using two different colors for 1900 and 2000 might have drawn a large visual division that would have separated the additive relationship I hoped to express here, since both years begin at 0, rather than ending or beginning where their areas' borders converge.</p>
                <p> I mainly hoped to show how the population spread across age has not only grown up in total amount (i.e. the total number of people has increased), but that the spread itself has grown more substantial. As shown by the chart, there is less of a skew in the data for younger ages in 2000 compared to 1900. In fact, the data seem to suggest that the population for both sexes has gotten older, and that the median age for each sex has shifted farther into adulthood from 1900 to 2000. So, in this way, I think this visualization does a good job of doing just that; it expresses the change in population size for both sexes by age from 1900 to 2000, and how this increase has affected age groups differently (i.e. the population increase did not map neatly onto the population composition in 1900.</p>
                  <hr>
                <p>I think these three visualizations work in concert to produce an interesting first look at the data, as they explore the main research question in divergent ways. The first two look at how the population has changed for both sexes between 1900 and 2000 as a percent change between different age groups. I think these visualizations do a strong job of showing where the population change in between age groups—where the population grows, shrinks, or stays the same relative to age—has changed from 1900 to 2000. And by focusing on percent change, rather than total population size, this graph withstands some of the immense change between years; it successfully focuses on proportional change, and thus normalizes the stark difference between 1900 and 2000. I think they are a bit weak, however, for some of the reasons mentioned above. I think the lack of historical context on these line charts sacrifices additional context that would have helped situate the trends shown here. That said, I think they still do an effective job of showing how 1900 and 2000 share commonalities in addition to differences, with respect to population change by age and sex. The third graph follows a different structure from the first two line charts, as it focuses on the total population along the top axis (y-axis) instead of percent change. It also flips the age variable by 90 degrees, so that it becomes a  vertical x axis. Years are labeled as shaded areas, and the sexes are organized on either side of the vertical x-axis. The visual organization of the data stands in stark contrast to a standard side-by-side bar chart, and using texture as the visual syntax for the data does a strong job of preserving the close relationship between the data and years, while also distinguishing them as two separate variables. Like the previous two charts, though, this final sketch does not incorporate contextual annotation that explains how these data are situated in time and place. I also think this visualization could be overly ambitious for the everyday reader. By condensing every measure and dimension within a single visualization, the graph could come across as too busy for those who would prefer a simpler chart. And by using an unconventional styling technique with dots, there could be a brief moment of confusion as to what the dots signify—compared to the facility of interpreting a larger circle or higher bar as “greater than” or “different from.” I like the focus of the first two visualizations, as they concentrate on changes within the data as proportional values. By calculating the data into percentages, these two charts normalize the total population difference between 1900 and 2000, and thus provide a more effective comparison to draw from. I also think the focus on proportions rather than totals tells a compelling story about how the population has evolved between age groups and sexes from 1900 and 2000; in short, it avoids reductive generalizations that claim “all age groups for both sexes saw a population increase from 1900 to 2000”. Taking that as my direction for my final design, I would like to see how these variables can effectively come together in a single visualization.</p>

        <h2>Summary </h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Upzoning efforts within the Metropolitan Boston area must grapple with the economic, racial, historical, and spatial diversity confronting the 101 municipalities of the region. In this exploratory analysis, some of the areas with the greatest potential for upzoning and diverse housing typologies were visualized. A look into the demographic profile of Metropolitan Boston, and the amount of land that has been allocated to Single-Family Zoning provides helpful insights into how exclusionary zoning has negatively impacted the lived reality of many today. More specifically, in areas with the highest percentage of Single-Family Zoning, income and racial disparities were highest, presenting a strong correlation between SFZ and demographic homogeneity; likewise, areas that permitted other housing typologies correlated with more diverse household incomes and higher proportions of the community that were non-white. Spatial insights also emerged from this analysis. Many suburban and urban communities with Single Family Zoning have existing, non-conforming housing typologies. These apparently “illegal” structures may provide useful precedents for upzoning initiatives, particularly in extant communities where other housing typologies represent a small share of the total residential area or receive recurring pushback from community leaders.</p> 
        <p>Further spatial analysis is needed to confirm many of the relationships drawn from this initial analysis. In addition to a closer look at the historical trend of these municipalities, and how they might have changed over time in response to watershed planning/policy interventions, additional analysis with additional data—such as housing classification, assessed value, and date of construction—needs to be done. This project did not visualize household size for families (nor non-families), so the next phase of research would explore housing density across Metropolitan Boston using household sizes as the key measure Incorporating these and other data into the project will raise new questions regarding zoning, housing availability, density, and demography. Expanding the scope and breadth of these data will help highlight the historical effects of exclusionary zoning and the areas of where upzoning might be most impactful.</p>
